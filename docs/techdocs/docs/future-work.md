# Future Work

The following ideas are being explored to evolve the platform:

- Support alternative databases such as SQLite for lightweight deployments.
- Publish a Helm chart to simplify Kubernetes deployments.
- Introduce high-availability mode with database replication and automatic failover.
- Integrate observability tooling (Prometheus, Grafana) for runtime metrics.
- Provide automated upgrade scripts to reduce maintenance effort.
